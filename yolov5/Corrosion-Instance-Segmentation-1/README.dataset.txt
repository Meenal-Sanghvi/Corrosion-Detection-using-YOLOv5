The provided dataset comprises a collection of images depicting corrosion, along with corresponding annotations in instance segmentation format. Each image in the dataset showcases instances of corrosion occurring on various surfaces. The annotations within the dataset accurately delineate the boundaries of individual corroded areas within each image. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating instance segmentation models specifically tailored for corrosion detection tasks.
