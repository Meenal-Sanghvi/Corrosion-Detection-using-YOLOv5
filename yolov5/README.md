üõ†Ô∏è Corrosion Detection using YOLOv5 üöß

This project is part of my Summer Research Internship and aims to develop a deep learning-based system for detecting corrosion on metal surfaces using the YOLOv5 object detection model.

üöÄ Project Overview
Goal: 
To build an AI tool that can automatically detect corrosion in industrial images to assist in preventive maintenance and inspection.

Technique Used:
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a labeled corrosion dataset.

Application:
Industrial inspection, infrastructure monitoring, non-destructive testing, preventive maintenance.

üîç How It Works
YOLOv5 takes an image as input and outputs bounding boxes around detected corrosion spots.
The model has been trained to detect corrosion based on features like color patterns, texture, and surface damage.
Non-Max Suppression (NMS) is used to eliminate overlapping predictions for clean and accurate results.
The model was trained and tested on a public corrosion detection dataset available on Roboflow.

üíæ Datasets Used
1. Public Dataset
Name: Corrosion Instance Segmentation
Source: Roboflow Universe
Size: 1000+ annotated images (COCO format)
Classes: Corrosion

2. Primary Dataset (Custom)
Collected Using: Mobile camera images of corroded metal surfaces.
Annotation Tool: Roboflow platform (bounding box format).
Size: 50+ manually annotated images specific to real-world industrial cases.
Purpose: Used to fine-tune and improve performance of the model on more realistic and diverse scenarios.

üíª How I Did It
Used YOLOv5s for the public dataset and YOLOv5m for the primary dataset (for improved accuracy).
Training and evaluation were done on Google Colab using GPU support.
Final trained model exported as TorchScript (best.torchscript) for cross-platform deployment.
Final inference tested and visualized using Visual Studio Code and Python virtual environment.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How To Run The Project (Windows)
Step 1: Open Terminal and Set Up Environment
cd corrosion_yolov5\yolov5
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Run Detection
python detect.py --weights best.torchscript --img 640 --conf 0.3 --source Corrosion-Instance-Segmentation-1/test/images

python detect.py --weights runs/train/corrosion_primary_m_1003/weights/best.pt --img 512 --conf 0.25 --source Corrosion-Primary/test/images --name detect_test --exist-ok
python detect.py --weights runs/train/corrosion_primary_m_1003/weights/best.pt --img 512 --conf 0.25 --source Corrosion-Primary/train/images --name detect_train --exist-ok
python detect.py --weights runs/train/corrosion_primary_m_1003/weights/best.pt --img 512 --conf 0.25 --source Corrosion-Primary/valid/images --name detect_valid --exist-ok

Output images with bounding boxes will be saved in the runs/detect/exp/ folder.

üì∏ Example Use Cases
Detect corrosion in real-time from drone footage or inspection cameras.
Automate defect tracking in oil, gas, marine, or industrial assets.
Help maintenance teams prioritize inspections using AI.
